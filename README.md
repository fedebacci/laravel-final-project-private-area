# PHP Specialization - Final project (backoffice)

Hi!
<br />
My name is Federico, I'm following a full-stack course with Boolean and this is my final project of the PHP specialization.


## TODO list when downloading from Github

- Make sure to have NPM downloaded on your system
- Make sure to have PHP downloaded on your system
- Make sure to have Composer downloaded on your system
- Open the project's terminal and run "npm i" to install npm dependencies
- Create a .env file copied from the .env.example one
- Create a DB schema named as the key "DB_DATABASE" inside that file (you can also change the value of the key and create the schema corresponding to the new value)
- Open the project's terminal and run "php artisan:migrate --seed" to create the necessary tables on the DB and populate them with the default data that I created.
- Run "php artisan serve" to start your local server and follow the link provided inside the terinal to open the app on your browser
- Split the terminal and run "npm run dev" to compile assets and Bootstrap with sass
- Enjoy!

## Project description

This is the backoffice, with authentication included, for an e-commerce dedicated to selling playing cards of any type (Classic "poker", Pok√®mon, Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh...)
<br />
Here you can read, create, modify or delete the products, selling single cards or full decks, which will be shown in the frontoffice app: "laravel-final-project-public-area" with APIs, where users would eventually buy them.
<br />
The frontoffice app is also available on my Github profile and is made using React.
